The long-awaited release of version 0.98 of JSXGraph is available for download.It contains a new element &#8220;slope triangle&#8221;, improved sector elements, an updated moodle plugin and many other smaller changes, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jsxgraph/jsxgraph/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). 
There has been a considerable speedup of the underlying SVG drawing, which results in a smooth handling on very small devices. As always, numerous bugs have been fixed. Version 0.98 will be available on CDN in a few days (hopefully).
  
Enjoy,
