With version 0.80 JSXGraph starts the support of multitouch devices like the Apple iPhone and iPod touch, or devices running Mozilla Fennec. Surprisingly, JSXGraph runs quite smoothly on these devices.
  
JSXGraph is part of the European Intergeo project (<http://i2geo.net>) and supports the Intergeo file format &#8211; as well as many other European Interactive Geometry software will do. This will enable the display of a huge amount of Geometry resources on multitouch devices like tablet computers.
  
To our knowledge, JSXGraph is the first platform-independent interactive Geometry software supporting multitouch devices like the iPhone or related devices.

You can watch demonstrations of JSXGraph on an _iPod touch_ at YouTube:

**Euler line**
  

  
**Bezier curves**
  


**Update Jan, 27. 2010**: We were not able to test it, but there should be no problems that prevent JSXGraph from running on the new _Apple iPad_.
