JSXGraph release v1.6.2 is a patch release. It fixes a regression from v1.6.1 which broke `foreignobject` elements.

There is one new feature: Additionally to an id string, `JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard()` accepts a reference to the hosting HTML object.

Enjoy,

Carsten Miller, Andreas Walter, and Alfred Wassermann
