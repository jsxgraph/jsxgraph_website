Dear friends of JSXGraph,

This is the 2nd announcement of the 2nd international JSXGraph conference.

Date: October 5th - 7th, 2021

Conference homepage: <https://jsxgraph.org/conf2021/>

After the success of the first JSXGraph conference in 2020,
the JSXGraph conference 2021 will bring together developers and teachers,
instructors and designers who are interested or already experienced in using
JSXGraph (<https://jsxgraph.org>) to enhance digital learning of STEM topics.

The conference will be an entirely online conference.
All participants are required to register
(<https://jsxgraph.org/conf/registration/>, registration is free).

We invite all participants to contribute a short talk or workshop and

- report about their concepts, experience, and workflow,
- present their applications and best practices,
- discuss pedagogical concepts involving JSXGraph.

The deadline for submission of talks / workshops is extended to **Friday, 24. September 2021**.
There are still a few time slots available.

Details about the video software will be announced at a later stage.

The 2nd international JSXGraph conference is organized by
the center of Mobile Learning with Digital Technology at the
University of Bayreuth, Germany (<https://mobiles-lernen.uni-bayreuth.de/>).

With thanks in advance and with best regards,

Carsten Miller, Alfred Wassermann
