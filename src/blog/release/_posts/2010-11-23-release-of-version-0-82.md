Today we released version 0.82 of JSXGraph. This release is a major step towards the support of as many devices as possible. Now, also the canvas element is supported by JSXGraph! This enables the use of JSXGraph on all Android devices. Thus, JSXGraph not only can be used on desktop computers with all major web browsers (even IE 6) and on iPhone, iPod touch and iPad by Apple. Now, all the Android based devices can display JSXGraph, too.
  
Further highlights of this release are the improved handling of multitouch events, locus computations, and root computations. New element types are [B-splines](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/B-splines), incircles, [Reuleaux polygons](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Reuleaux_pentagon), and [roulettes (rolling curves)](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Rolling_circle_on_line). Mathematical texts may use [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) now, bringing the quality of [TeX](http://tug.org/) to JSXGraph. Further, the parsing of math syntax has been improved. Finally, this release contains many bug fixes, the source has been refactored considerably, and we now use unit tests to improve the stability of the code. Our [wiki](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/) contains many new examples.
