Finally 0.93 is out! Version 0.93 introduces many new features, like segments of fixed length, magnetized points, and Catmull-Rom splines. Further, the handling of mouse events and touch events has been much improved. Many new options were introduced. For example, it is now possible to supply CSS classes for individual HTML texts. Many bugs have been fixed, especially during during creation and deletion of multiple boards in one HTML file.
  
Unfortunately, at some places we had to break backward compatibility, see the [sourceforge trac wiki](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jsxgraph/wiki/ChangeLog) for more information.
  
You can see information about the new elements in our [wiki](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Documentation) and of course in the [documentation](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/docs/) which has also been much improved. Here is a complete [list of all possible attributes](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Options).
  
Version 0.93 should appear soon at the CDN at <http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsxgraph/0.93/jsxgraphcore.js>.
  
Enjoy!
