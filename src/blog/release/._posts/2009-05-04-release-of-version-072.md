The release 0.72 of JSXGraph contains many bug fixes and speed improvements. The highlight of this release is a pure JavaScript implementation of unzip and gunzip. This will enable the display of Intergeo constructions (http://i2geo.net). Further new features are: export from JSXGraph to pstricks (LaTeX), point coordinates are shown on mouseover (infobox), Riemann sums. The wiki contains many new examples.
