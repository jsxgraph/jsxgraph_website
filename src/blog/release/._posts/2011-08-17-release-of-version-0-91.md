Today we released the next step of JSXGraph on the road to version 1.0. Version 0.91 enables the dragging of lines, circles, texts and images. Axes are considerably improved as well as the handling of touch events on iOS and Android. Many bugs have been fixed, the import of GEONExT and Intergeo files is more stable now. The documentation has been expanded significantly.
  
Happy JSXGraphing,
  
Alfred
