Dear friends of JSXGraph,
we are happy to announce that since November 2018 JSXGraph is funded by the European Union in form of the Erasmus+ project ITEMS: <https://itemspro.eu/> (See also the [list of project partners](https://itemspro.eu/partners/)).

Part of this project will be several workshops in the next months on creation of learning materials.

* First, there is an online course-seminar "Creating Moodle FORMULAS type questions for STEM subjects". 
Date: *March 18th to April 8th 2019*. 
This *free* course / seminar is organized on behalf of the SCORE project and in collaboration with the ITEMS project.  
[SCORE](https://scorepro.eu/courses/c44.html) and [ITEMS](https://itemspro.eu/) are 
European [ERASMUS+ KA2](https://www.erasmusplus.org.uk/key-action-2) projects aimed at developing 
*Maths* and *Physics* materials in the Moodle platform. 
* Second, there will be the workshop on 
"*Creation of research-based digital materials (Moodle) to develop STEM competences*".
It is a *free* course organized by [Center for Mobile Learning with Digital Technology, University of Bayreuth](http://mobile-learning.uni-bayreuth.de/) in collaboration with Alicante University. 
It will take place in *Alicante* (Spain) from *September 3rd to September 6th 2019*. 
Information can be found at the [workshop website](https://itemspro.eu/courses/ka1course.html) and
