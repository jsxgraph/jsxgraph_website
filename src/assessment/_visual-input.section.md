# Visual input with JSXGraph

In contrast, visual input methods using JSXGraph enable students to interact with geometric objects directly. 
Instead of typing expressions, learners manipulate constructions, move points, or adapt function graphs in a coordinate system. 
This opens new possibilities for assessing spatial reasoning, geometric understanding, and problem-solving strategies that are difficult to capture through symbolic input alone.

Combining both approaches—algebraic and visual—can provide a more complete picture of student understanding and make digital assessment more accessible, especially for visual learners.
