# STACK Online Assessment

_STACK_ is a server-based assessment system for mathematics that evaluates student input using symbolic algebra in _Moodle_ or _ILIAS_ courses. It allows learners to enter answers as mathematical expressions, which are then automatically analyzed and checked for correctness, structure, and equivalence. 

JSXGraph can be integrated into STACK questions to enable interactive, visual input. This allows students to move geometric figures, drag points, or manipulate parameters of functions directly within the question—adding a dynamic, visual dimension to traditional formula-based assessment. 

JSXGraph is already built into STACK, so there’s no need for separate installation.

# Formulas Question Type (Moodle)

_Formulas_ is a Moodle question type that supports algebraic input, symbolic evaluation, randomization, and automated feedback—making it well-suited for both formative and summative assessment.

Interactive elements—such as JSXGraph constructions—can be embedded to enable visual input and dynamic manipulation within Formulas questions. 
The _Formulas extension_ for the _Moodle JSXGraph filter_ facilitates the two-way exchange of values between the question logic and the interactive JSXGraph diagrams.
