Digital assessment is playing an increasingly central role in both school and university mathematics education. 
Beyond the automation of grading, modern assessment systems are capable of interpreting student input at a symbolic level, allowing for more nuanced evaluations and richer feedback. 
This capability enables a shift from assessing final answers alone to analyzing the structure and reasoning behind studentsâ€™ solutions.

Traditional digital assessment systems like STACK rely on students entering mathematical expressions in algebraic form.
These inputs are evaluated symbolically, allowing for precise feedback on correctness, structure, and underlying misconceptions.
This approach is well-suited for tasks involving algebra, calculus, and symbolic manipulation.
