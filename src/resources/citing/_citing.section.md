# Embed a Link to JSXGraph

You can easily link to the JSXGraph website by adding the logo to your own website: 

<a href="https://jsxgraph.org" target="_blank" title="Visit JSXGraph">
    <img src="https://jsxgraph.org/home/media/logos/jsxgraph/png/screen/jsxgraph-logo_blue-banner-solid-text-solid.png" 
         alt="JSXGraph Logo" 
         width="200" 
         style="width:200px;cursor:pointer;">
</a>

The preferred way is to download the official logo (see [Logo Files]({{ relBase }}/resources/logos)) and make it clickable with a link to 

`https://jsxgraph.org`

As an alternative, you can use the provided HTML embedding code to reference the JSXGraph website directly.

```
<a href="https://jsxgraph.org" target="_blank" title="Visit JSXGraph">
    <img src="https://jsxgraph.org/home/media/logos/jsxgraph/png/screen/jsxgraph-logo_blue-banner-solid-text-solid.png" 
         alt="JSXGraph Logo" 
         width="200" 
         style="width:200px;cursor:pointer;">
</a>
```

Different versions of the logo are available in the [Logo Files]({{ relBase }}/resources/logos) section, allowing you to choose the style that best fits your design.

# Spelling of JSXGraph

The correct capitalization is ‘JSXG’ in uppercase, followed by ‘raph’ in lowercase — written exactly as ‘JSXGraph’.
This consistent styling reflects the project’s name and should be used in all formal references.

It should not be written as ‘jsXgraph’, ‘JSXgraph’, or in all lowercase, to maintain consistency and brand identity.
