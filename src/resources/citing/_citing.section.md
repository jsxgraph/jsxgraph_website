# How to Embed a Link to JSXGraph’s Website

A clickable logo can link users to the JSXGraph site seamlessly: 

<a href="https://jsxgraph.org" target="_blank" title="Visit JSXGraph">
    <img src="https://jsxgraph.org/home/media/logos/jsxgraph/png/screen/jsxgraph-logo_blue-banner-solid-text-solid.png" 
         alt="JSXGraph Logo" 
         width="200" 
         style="width:200px;cursor:pointer;">
</a>

You can reference the JSXGraph website directly in your own projects using HTML embedding:

```
<a href="https://jsxgraph.org" target="_blank" title="Visit JSXGraph">
    <img src="https://jsxgraph.org/home/media/logos/jsxgraph/png/screen/jsxgraph-logo_blue-banner-solid-text-solid.png" 
         alt="JSXGraph Logo" 
         width="200" 
         style="width:200px;cursor:pointer;">
</a>
```

Different versions of the logo are available in the [Logo Files]({{ relBase }}/resources/logos) section, allowing you to choose the style that best fits your design.
This makes it easy to integrate JSXGraph branding into your pages professionally.

# Spelling

The correct capitalization is ‘JSXG’ in uppercase, followed by ‘raph’ in lowercase — written exactly as ‘JSXGraph’.
This consistent styling reflects the project’s name and should be used in all formal references.

It should not be written as ‘jsXgraph’, ‘JSXgraph’, or in all lowercase, to maintain consistency and brand identity.
