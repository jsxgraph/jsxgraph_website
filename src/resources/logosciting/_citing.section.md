# How to Cite JSXGraph

## Citing

JSXGraph. Center for Mobile Learning with Digital Technology – University of Bayreuth, Germany. <https://jsxgraph.org>

## Spelling

Pay attention to the correct capitalization:
‘JSXG’ in uppercase, followed by ‘raph’ in lowercase — written exactly as ‘JSXGraph’.
This consistent styling reflects the project’s name and should be used in all formal references.

It should not be written as ‘jsXgraph’, ‘JSXgraph’, or in all lowercase, to maintain consistency and brand identity.
