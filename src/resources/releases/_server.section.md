# Server

JSXGraph can be downloaded at least from
[jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/jsxgraph),
[cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jsxgraph),
[Node.js (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsxgraph) and
our JSXGraph server hosted at the University of Bayreuth.

The links always have a specific structure. For permanent hosting of the
library `jsxgraphcore.js` we highly recommend either download and local hosting or CDN
hosting at jsDelivr or cdnjs.
