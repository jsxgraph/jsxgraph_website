JSXGraph can be embedded into various systems as a plugin or through filter mechanisms, enabling seamless integration into platforms such as Moodle, STACK, Jupyter Notebook, and static HTML pages. This flexibility allows educators and developers to enhance digital learning environments with interactive mathematical visualizations across diverse technical contexts.

# Moodle LMS

![Moodle]({{ relBase }}/media/logos-external/logo-moodle.png)

The JSXGraph filter for Moodle enables function plotting and dynamic geometry constructions with JSXGraph within a Moodle platform.
Using the JSXGraph filter makes it a lot easier to embed JSXGraph constructions into Moodle online documents, e.g. in contents like page, quiz, link, ... .

# ILIAS LMS

The filter integrates interactive JSXGraph visualizations into ILIAS as a Page Component, allowing users to explore mathematical and scientific concepts through dynamic diagrams and graphs, enriching both instructional content and learner engagement. 

It is a third-party plugin that is not developed or maintained by the JSXGraph project itself.

# STACK Online Assessment

![STACK]({{ relBase }}/media/logos-external/logo-stack.png)

The combination of STACK and JSXGraph enables the creation of assessment questions with visual input in automated online testing environments. In such tasks, students respond through visual interactionsâ€”for example, by moving a point to specific coordinates or transforming geometric objects. 

JSXGraph can be used not only for capturing visual input but also for merely illustrating or visualizing the question prompt. JSXGraph is already integrated into STACK and does not require separate installation. However, it is important to note that the JSXGraph component provided within STACK is designed exclusively for use inside STACK and does not replace the general-purpose JSXGraph filter.

# Formulas Question Type (Moodle)

The Formulas extension for the Moodle JSXGraph filter facilitates the two-way exchange of values between formulas question logic and interactive JSXGraph visualizations.

# MediaWiki

The MediaWiki plugin for JSXGraph enables the embedding of interactive JSXGraph constructions directly into wiki pages using simple tags. It provides an easy way to integrate dynamic mathematical visualizations into collaborative documentation platforms.

The JSXGraph plugin for WordPress is outdated.
If there is interest, this version could serve as a basis for further development.

# Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook and JSXGraph are powerful open-source tools that enable the creation of interactive, web-based mathematical content by combining executable code, dynamic visualizations, and explanatory text. Their integration allows for rich, exploratory learning environments in mathematics, science, and education.
