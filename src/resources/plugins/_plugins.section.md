JSXGraph can be embedded into various systems as a plugin or through filter mechanisms, enabling seamless integration into platforms such as Moodle, STACK, Jupyter Notebook, and static HTML pages. This flexibility allows educators and developers to enhance digital learning environments with interactive mathematical visualizations across diverse technical contexts.

# Moodle LMS

The JSXGraph plugin for Moodle enables function plotting and dynamic geometry constructions with JSXGraph within a Moodle platform.
Using the JSXGraph filter makes it a lot easier to embed JSXGraph constructions into Moodle online documents, e.g. in contents like page, quiz, link, ... .

# STACK Online Assessment

The combination of STACK and JSXGraph enables the creation of assessment questions with visual input. In such tasks, students respond by performing visual actionsâ€”for example, by moving a point to specific coordinates or transforming a geometric figure.

# Formulas Question Type (Moodle)

The Formulas extension for the Moodle JSXGraph filter facilitates the two-way exchange of values between formulas question logic and interactive JSXGraph visualizations.

Jupyter Notebook and JSXGraph are powerful open-source tools that enable the creation of interactive, web-based mathematical content by combining executable code, dynamic visualizations, and explanatory text. Their integration allows for rich, exploratory learning environments in mathematics, science, and education.
