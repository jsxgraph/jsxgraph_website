# Students' Projects

Students on software internships at the University of Bayreuth develop their own projects using JSXGraph. 
These projects enable them to apply their programming skills to a mathematical context and gain experience in creating complex applications.

# Examples from Erasmus+ Projects

JSXGraph was successfully used in the Erasmus+ projects ITEMS and COMPASS to design interactive mathematical learning environments. 
The developed examples ranged from dynamic geometry tasks to visualized functions and simulations of mathematical concepts.

# Meclib

Meclib is a toolset designed to simplify the creation of STACK questions in Moodle by providing high-level support for JSXGraph-based illustrations controlled via Maxima. 
Its focus lies on interactive graphics and rich formative feedback, particularly for applications such as parametrized geometry and free body diagrams in mechanics.
