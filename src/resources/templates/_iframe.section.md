# iFrame Integration

Integrating a JSXGraph figure into an iframe involves embedding the JSXGraph code in a standalone HTML file. This file is then referenced via the src attribute of the iframe to display the interactive content.

The iframe creates a separate execution environment, reducing the risk of interference or injection between the main page and the JSXGraph script.
