There are different ways to include JSXGraph in an HTML file. The most common method is to load the library from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This approach is simple and ensures that the latest version is always available, but it requires an internet connection.

Alternatively, JSXGraph can be locally hosted, meaning the library files are downloaded and served from the same server as the website. This method offers full control over the version used and also works offline.
