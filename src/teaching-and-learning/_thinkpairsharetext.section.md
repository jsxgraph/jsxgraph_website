Teaching and learning with sketchometry teaching modules according to the "Think-Pair-Share" method.

The aim of this approach is a combination of active, independent work phases of the students (guided by assignments to construct, explore, document, and discuss) and a presentation and results assurance phase moderated by the teacher.

# Think-Phase

First, the students work independently on the worksheet. 
They work on the respective construction task and then carry out the investigation tasks. 
At the same time, they write down their observations and assumptions on the result sheet. 
The teacher provides help for self-help if necessary or on request.

# Pair-Phase
The students compare their results with those of their neighbors or within their learning group. 
If necessary, they add comments to their notes. The teacher observes the individual learning groups and is again available for advice (help for self-help). 
In doing so, the teacher finds out which assumptions or solutions are produced and thus gains an overview of the results achieved.

# Share-Phase
The results are discussed with the whole class. 
This can be done based on a completed result sheet of a learning group. 
In this more teacher-centered phase the teacher guides the discussion, corrects – if necessary – the results presented and makes any necessary additions. 
New terms can also be introduced in this phase.

Together with the students a sample result sheet can be created, which is then made available to the whole class, electronically or as a printout.

This approach is recommended rather than a result sheet prepared by the teacher. 
Otherwise, there is a danger that the students will not contribute enough themselves, because they know that they will receive a finished result sheet from the teacher.
