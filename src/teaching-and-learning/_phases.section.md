# Construction phase

The students' worksheets contain some construction assignments.
These are short instructions for developing their own construction with sketchometry.
The students are actively involved.

# Exploration phase

In the subsequent exploration phase instructions on the worksheet encourage learners

- to experiment with their construction,
- to make conjectures,
- to take handwritten notes and sketches.

In addition to the construction the focus is on intensive engagement with the mathematical problem.
