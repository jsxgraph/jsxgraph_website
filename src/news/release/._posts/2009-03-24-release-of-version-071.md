The release 0.71 of JSXGraph contains major improvements of ticks on lines. Equidistant and special ticks are possible now. Further it contains much improved automatic labeling of axes, see <http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Ticks> for a description. The snap-to-grid mode has been enabled again. Further the release contains many bug fixes, among them the fix of a problem with lines and curves having points far outside of the drawing panel. The JSXGraph plugins for WordPress, Moodle and MediaWiki have been improved. The [demo wiki](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Category:Examples) contains many new examples.
