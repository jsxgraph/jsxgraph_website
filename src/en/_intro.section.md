# Sketch. Explore. Understand.

You draw with your finger on your smartphone or tablet.
sketchometry converts your sketches into precise geometric constructions that you can modify and move.

Mathematics becomes an experimental subject.
No ready-made results are presented, learners are encouraged to go on a journey of discovery by themselves.

sketchometry is free of charge and can be used both at school and at home.
