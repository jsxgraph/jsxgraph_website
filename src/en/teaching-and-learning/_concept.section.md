# Concept
The concept of the sketchometry teaching modules enables the transition from passive-receptive teaching to active discovery learning.

The content is not presented as a "ready-made system". 
In a construction phase learners first get instructions on paper worksheets on how to construct objects and configurations with sketchometry.
In the subsequent exploration phase work assignments are given that encourage learners to experiment independently and then to document the results by handwritten notes.
