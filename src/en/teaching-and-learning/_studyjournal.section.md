# Handwritten notes, also in the study journal

With increasing experience students will be able to document their observations and results more independently and without a predefined structure.
They then write down their ideas, sketches, assumptions and results in their exercise book or study journal.
This can also include constructions with compass and ruler.

Handwritten notes and revisiting the interactive content initiate a further, deeper learning process and support sustainable learning success.
