JSXGraph supports accessibility through integration with ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) standards. Authors can apply all relevant ARIA roles, labels, and properties to JSXGraph containers and interactive elements, enabling screen readers to interpret mathematical content more effectively. With attributes like `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and `aria-live`, all individual JSXGraph elements can be enriched with semantic information to improve the accessibility of dynamic visualizations.

Individual elements can receive keyboard focus via `tabIndex`, and once focused, users can interact with them using custom keyboard controls. This allows for inclusive navigation without requiring a mouse, making interactive mathematics more accessible to all users.

```js
var A = board.create('point', [2, 3], {
   name: 'A',
   tabIndex: 0,
   aria: {
       enabled: true,
       label: (self) => `${self.name} is at ${self.X().toFixed(1)} ${self.Y().toFixed(1)}`,
       live: 'polite'
   }
});
```

In addition, JSXGraph visualizations can be enriched with descriptive text, keyboard navigation support, and dynamic announcements to assist users with visual impairments. 

These features help ensure that interactive mathematics is accessible and inclusive across a wider range of users.
