### Control structures

The control structures are exactly the same as in JavaScript.

_if_

```js
if (<expression)
{
    <Stmt>
        } else if (
        <expression>) {
            <Stmt>
                } else {
                <Stmt>
                    }
```

_while_ loop

```js
while (<expression>) {
    <Stmt>
        }
```

_do_ loop

```js
do {
    <Stmt>
        } while (
        <expression>);
```

_for_ loop

```js
for (<assignment>;
    <expression>;
        <assignment>) {
            <Stmt>
                }
```
