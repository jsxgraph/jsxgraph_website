The [JSXGraph Book](https://ipesek.github.io/jsxgraphbook/) provides a comprehensive introduction to dynamic mathematics with JSXGraph, covering both fundamental concepts and advanced interactive applications. 
It is an essential resource for educators, developers, and authors interested in creating web-based mathematical visualizations.

The following steps will guide you through the initial setup of JSXGraph and help you create your first interactive JSXGraph visualization.

# Step 1 â€“ Include JSXGraph

You can work with JSXGraph either directly in a web browser using online resources, or offline by downloading the required files on your local machine. 

We recommend using a modern code editor to write and test your HTML file with the JSXGraph code efficiently.

## Online Usage

The preferred way is to include JSXGraph online from one of the CDNs (Content Delivery Network).
Add the following lines into the HTML document head:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8" 
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsxgraph/distrib/jsxgraphcore.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsxgraph/distrib/jsxgraph.css" />
```

## Complete HTML File (Online Usage)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My JSXGraph Example</title>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8"
            src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsxgraph/distrib/jsxgraphcore.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsxgraph/distrib/jsxgraph.css" />
</head>
<body>
    ...
</body>
</html>
```

## Local Usage

If you want to include a local copy of JSXGraph in your HTML file,
download the two following JSXGraph files

- <https://jsxgraph.org/distrib/jsxgraphcore.js>
- <https://jsxgraph.org/distrib/jsxgraph.css>

and add the following lines into the document head:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jsxgraph.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="jsxgraphcore.js"></script>
```

## Complete HTML File (Local Usage)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My JSXGraph Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jsxgraph.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jsxgraphcore.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    ...
</body>
</html>
```
