Since 2010

University of Bayreuth

sketchometry is a user interface built on the foundation of JSXGraph. sketchometry enables students to draw and manipulate geometric constructions using simple gestures. The software automatically recognizes shapes and relationships, providing a seamless transition from rough sketches to precise constructions. Designed specifically for digital classrooms, sketchometry promotes active learning and supports a deeper understanding of geometry.

Since 2010

University of Bayreuth

JSXCompressor is a JavaScript-based utility from the open-source JSXGraph project that enables deflate, unzip, and base64 decoding directly in the browser, allowing for the transmission and execution of compressed JavaScript, XML, or JSON data without server-side compression. It can be used in combination with PHP to embed compressed, base64-encoded scripts into HTML, making it a useful tool when server-side gzip compression is not available.

# Everything is Number

> /media/logos-external/logo-ein.jpg

Since 2008

University of Bayreuth

The Pythagoreans believed that numbers are hidden in everything—from musical harmonies to the movement of the planets—and concluded: “Everything is number.” Inspired by this idea, Swiss artist Eugen Jost explores numbers and language in his art. Some of his artworks have been made interactive using JSXGraph. These digital versions allow viewers to explore the mathematical structures.
