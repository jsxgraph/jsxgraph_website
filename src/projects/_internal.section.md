sketchometry is an educational geometry tool that enables students to draw and manipulate geometric constructions using simple gestures. The software automatically recognizes shapes and relationships, providing a seamless transition from sketch to construction. Ideal for digital classrooms, sketchometry fosters active learning and helps students develop a deeper understanding of geometry through touch-based interaction.

# Everything is Number

Since 2008

The Pythagoreans believed that numbers are hidden in everything—from musical harmonies to the movement of the planets—and concluded: “Everything is number.” Inspired by this idea, Swiss artist Eugen Jost explores numbers and language in his art. Some of his artworks have been made interactive using JSXGraph. These digital versions allow viewers to explore the mathematical structures.
