sketchometry is an educational geometry tool that enables students to draw and manipulate geometric constructions using simple gestures. The software automatically recognizes shapes and relationships, providing a seamless transition from sketch to construction. Ideal for digital classrooms, sketchometry fosters active learning and helps students develop a deeper understanding of geometry through touch-based interaction.
