In the [JSXGraph wiki](https://jsxgraph.org/wiki) there are now several examples for intersection of curves, polygons, and circles. The clipping algorithm is an implementation of the *Greiner-Hormann algorithm*. Please, report failures.

The new examples are:

* <https://jsxgraph.org/wiki/index.php/Intersection_of_circles>
* <https://jsxgraph.org/wiki/index.php/Intersection_of_curves_I>
* <https://jsxgraph.org/wiki/index.php/Intersection_of_curves_II>
* <https://jsxgraph.org/wiki/index.php/Intersection_of_functiongraphs>

Due to a wrong git tag, the CDN still did not update to version v1.00.0. 
The latest version there is v1.35 which comes from this wrong tag and is v0.99.6.

Stay healthy,
Alfred
