Dear friends of JSXGraph,

from 18.1.2021 until 28.2.2021 there will be a free MOOC on materials for teaching High School Physics 
from the project [ITEMS](https://itemspro.eu). The materials rely heavily on JSXGraph.

Course duration is 6 weeks with a total number of 4 modules (one module per week), 
one week at the beginning for course introduction and one further week at the end of the course. 
The estimated workload is 2-3 hours per week.
Participation in the course guarantees access to a bank of questions created by ITEMS partnership and 
advice on its implementation in Moodle.
Moodle material is being built in such a way that it can be translated easily. 

The course languages will be English and Spanish.

Everybody is invited to register and join the MOOC.

The JSXGraph team
