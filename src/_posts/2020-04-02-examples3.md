Today we have to new examples:

* <https://jsxgraph.org/wiki/index.php/Fullscreen_mode>: The user can click on an icon in the JSXGraphnavigation bar on the lower right or click on an external button provided by the content creator to display a JSXGraph construction in full screen mode. This can be useful in classroom situations
* <https://jsxgraph.org/wiki/index.php/N-th_root>: it seems to be a much requested feature to be a able to plot the cube root function or in general the *n*-th root function, where *n* is an odd integer, also for negative values. This is enabled by the new functions __cbrt(x)__ and __nthroot(x, n)__

Enjoy, 
Alfred
