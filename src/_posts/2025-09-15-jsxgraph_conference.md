Dear friends of JSXGraph,

this is the 3rd announcement of the 6th International JSXGraph conference.

The JSXGraph conference 2025 is approaching very fast! At https://jsxgraph.org/conf2025/program you can find the list of talks announced so far. A few
slots are still available, we will accept talks **until September 19th, at midnight (CEST)**.

Please, spread the word - also to beginners. As last years, there will be again a JSXGraph introductory workshop.

Will send out the Zoom link a couple of days ahead of the conference.

With thanks in advance and with best regards,  
Carsten Miller, Alfred Wassermann (Organizers)
