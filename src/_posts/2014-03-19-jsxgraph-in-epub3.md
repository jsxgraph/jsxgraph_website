We have been asked a couple of times if JSXGraph can be embedded into epub3 ebooks. Here is a small ebook example about the <a title="Theoerem of Thales" href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/distrib/Thales.epub" target="_blank">Theorem of Thales</a> (as called in Germany). It is realized as fixed layout ebook and uses JSXGraph, based on JavaScript and SVG.

Enjoy,
