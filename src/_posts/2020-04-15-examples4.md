Today, I want to show you a neat trick to create *scatter plots* with a large number of points. Of course, it is possible to use JSXGraph *points*, 
but this might be overkill and need too much resources. A more efficient approach is to use the JSXGraph *curve* object: For each point we simply add two coordinate
entries and one NaN entry. The NaN entry will interrupt the line stroke. You can see it at <https://jsxgraph.org/wiki/index.php/Scatter_plot>.

Enjoy, 
Alfred
