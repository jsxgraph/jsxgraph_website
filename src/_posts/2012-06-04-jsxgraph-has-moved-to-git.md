We moved our version control from Subversion to Git. We also created a [project page at GitHub](https://github.com/jsxgraph/jsxgraph) to make it easier for you to report bugs and feature requests and to participate in the development of JSXGraph.

If you are not familiar with Git you can find a lot of good ressources on the web, e.g. <http://git-scm.com/documentation> and the [GitHub help](http://help.github.com) pages.

To access our Git repository at SourceForge use 

<pre>git://jsxgraph.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/jsxgraph/jsxgraph</pre>

See [this SourceForge page](http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group_id=238469) for more information. To access our Git repository at GitHub use 

<pre>git://github.com/jsxgraph/jsxgraph.git</pre>

or fork our repository and use your fork&#8217;s URI if you are planning to contribute to our project.
