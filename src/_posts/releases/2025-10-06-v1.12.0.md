Dear friends of JSXGraph,

JSXGraph v1.12.0 mainly improves 3D functionality: it is now able to read and write polyhedra in the [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) file format (ASCII only, so far), 3D transformations have been further improved.

JSXGraph has updated its logo. It can be downloaded in many flavors from the new designed homepage <https://jsxgraph.org>. The copyright string is now much shorter and contains the new logo. With the new board attribute `showLogo` it is possible to show just the logo.

The use of the attribute `frozen` which makes the position of elements independent of the zoom level is now much simplified. This is useful especially for sliders.
Implicit curves are now clipped and don't overlap their domain anymore.

Additionally, 3D performance could be improved and multiple bugs were fixed. 

Enjoy, Alfred
