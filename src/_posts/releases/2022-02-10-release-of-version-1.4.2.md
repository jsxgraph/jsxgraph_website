JSXGraph v1.4.2 is a patch release. It mainly fixes a code regression
which prevented using JSXGraph on iOS versions below 13 and removes the
5 pixel bounding box of elements receiving focus in webkit browsers.
Minor issues were `beautifulScientificTickLabels` for numbers with
negative exponents and gradient fill colors for point elements.
Further, the TypeScript definition file `index.d.ts` and keyboard
control has been improved significantly.

Thanks to all contributors who have helped to improve JSXGraph!

Enjoy,

Matthias Ehmann, Michael Gerh√§user, Carsten Miller, Andreas Walter, and Alfred Wassermann
