Dear friends of JSXGraph,

JSXGraph has a new look and it’s more than just a facelift:

The JSXGraph logo comes in three layouts (_text_, _square_, _banner_) each suited for different uses.

### Evolving the JSXGraph Logo

The JSXGraph logo has undergone a thoughtful redesign—one that remains rooted in the mathematical essence of JSXGraph while embracing new dimensions, both literally and conceptually.

At the heart of the new design is the familiar graphical element of the JSXGraph board.

It continues to serve as a visual anchor, preserving the connection to JSXGraph’s core identity.

What sets the redesign apart is the introduction of a subtle 3D component—an elegant nod to JSXGraph’s evolving capabilities, particularly its support for three-dimensional constructions and visualizations.

This updated visual identity does more than refresh the look. It reflects JSXGraph’s broadened scope in dynamic, interactive mathematics—while staying anchored in its foundational concepts.

The _circle_ continues to represent the domain of interactive geometry, highlighting JSXGraph’s strength in constructing and exploring geometric figures.

The _coordinate system_, in turn, stands for the representation of function graphs and curves, emphasizing the framework’s capabilities in plotting and analyzing mathematical relationships.

The new logo stands as a forward-looking symbol of JSXGraph’s mission: to make mathematics interactive, multidimensional, and accessible—empowering a new generation of learners, educators, and innovators:
