Dear community,

It's time to bid farewell to our old Google Groups discussion forum and hello to a brand new, modern platform! After careful evaluation, we've chosen to host our new forum at <https://forum.jsxgraph.org>, built on the open-source Discourse software (<https://github.com/discourse/discourse>).

### Easy Registration and Posting
Registration is a breeze: you can sign up with your Google account, Github account, or manually create an account. And the best part? You can start posting right away, with no moderation needed (for now). We're excited to see our community come together and share their ideas!

### Future Plans: Live Example Testing
We're working on developing a JSXGraph plug-in for the forum, which will enable live testing of examples. Your input and feedback are invaluable to us, so please share your thoughts and ideas on how to make this feature shine.

### Transition Notice
Our old Google Groups forum will remain open, but we encourage everyone to join us on our new platform. We're confident that this change will bring a fresh and modern discussion experience to our community.

### Get Involved!
We'd love for you to start or join discussions on our new forum, exploring new ideas and ways to use JSXGraph. Let's make this community thrive!

Best regards, Alfred, on behalf of the JSXGraph team
