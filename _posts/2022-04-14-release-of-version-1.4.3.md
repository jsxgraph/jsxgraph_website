Version v1.4.3 is a patch release. Most importantly, JSXGraph can now be used as ES6 module and 
contains multiple improvements in index.d.ts for TypeScript support. 
Other bug fixes can be seen in the CHANGELOG.

Additionally, this release contains preliminary, experimental support of 3D elements. 
See the examples in <ttps://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/~alfred/jsxdev/3D/> for a first preview. 
A detailed blog post on the will follow [here](https://jsxgraph.org/wp/blog/). 
Please, do not yet use 3D elements in production, the API may still change.

Enjoy,

Matthias Ehmann, Michael Gerh√§user, Carsten Miller, Andreas Walter, and Alfred Wassermann
