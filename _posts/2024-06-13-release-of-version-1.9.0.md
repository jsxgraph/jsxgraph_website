JSXGraph release v1.9.1 is a quick patch release after yesterday's release of v1.9.0. 

It fixes a regression that broke the setting of label colors for certain elements.
To be precise, label attributes for non-primitive elements were broken in general.

Additionally, a very specific import problem could be fixed, only affecting developers.
And finally, all `eslint` warnings have now been addressed.

Again, we want to announce the 5th JSXGraph conference on October 8-10, 2024 (online and free). The conference homepage is <https://jsxgraph.org/conf2024/>. Everybody is invited to show her/his work with JSXGraph. Also, there will be a workshop with new features of JSXGraph in 2024.

Enjoy, 

Carsten Miller, Andreas Walter, and Alfred Wassermann
