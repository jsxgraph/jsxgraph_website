 * Disable browser handling of all panning and zooming gestures.

 * Enable single-finger horizontal panning gestures. May be combined with pan-y, pan-up, pan-down and/or pinch-zoom.

 * pan-y
 * Enable single-finger vertical panning gestures. May be combined with pan-x, pan-left, pan-right and/or pinch-zoom.
 *
 * manipulation
 * Enable panning and pinch zoom gestures, but disable additional non-standard gestures such as double-tap to zoom.
 * Disabling double-tap to zoom removes the need for browsers to delay the generation of click events when the user taps the screen.
 * This is an alias for "pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom" (which, for compatibility, is itself still valid).
 *
 * pan-left, pan-right, pan-up, pan-down
 * Enable single-finger gestures that begin by scrolling in the given direction(s).
 * Once scrolling has started, the direction may still be reversed.
 * Note that scrolling "up" (pan-up) means that the user is dragging their finger downward on the screen surface,
 * and likewise pan-left means the user is dragging their finger to the right. Multiple directions may be combined
 * except when there is a simpler representation (for example, "pan-left pan-right" is invalid since "pan-x" is simpler,
 * but "pan-left pan-down" is valid).
 *
 * pinch-zoom
 * Enable multi-finger panning and zooming of the page. This may be combined with any of the pan-values.
