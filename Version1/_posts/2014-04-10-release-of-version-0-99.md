It&#8217;s out! We just released JSXGraph version 0.99. The most notable changes are a completely new plotting algorithm for function graphs and curves (If one wants to use the plotting algorithm of version 0.98, the attribute doAdvancedPlotOld:true can be supplied). Further, there are new elements:

  * polarline,
  * polarpoint,
  * radicalaxis
  * stepfunction
  * cardinal splines

Thanks to our contributors of code. It is good to have helping hands all over the world. Additionally, the visual appearance of the navigation bar has been improved, speed has been improved and many bugs could be fixed. The details can be seen in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jsxgraph/jsxgraph/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Best wishes, Alfred
