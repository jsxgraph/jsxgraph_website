Yesterday we presented JSXGraph at the [CADGME 09 conference](http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/cadgme2009/) which is hosted in the beautifully located Castle of Hagenberg, Austria. Among many other things we showed the interaction between JSXGraph and [jquery](http://jqueryui.com/) widgets, the computation of geometric loci on server side using [CoCoa](http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/), and the display of [Intergeo](i2geo.net) and [GeoGebra](http://www.geogebra.org) files with JSXGraph. The [HTML slides of our talk](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/talks/cadgme09/talk/) (presented by Michael Gerh√§user, Bianca Valentin, and Alfred Wassermann) are [online on our web page](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/talks/cadgme09/talk/). The HTML template for this presentation has been written by Carsten Miller. It uses some special features of the Firefox 3.5.
