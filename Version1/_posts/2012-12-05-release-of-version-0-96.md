Version 0.96 enables dragging polygons and curves. Constructions created with [sketchometry](http://www.sketchometry.com "sketchometry") can now be read and displayed with JSXGraph. The environments in which JSXGraph can be used has been extended to node.js and Windows 8 apps.

Unfortunately, this version will not be hosted by CDNJS. This CDN only accepts libraries with at least 100 stars on GitHub. If you have a (free) GitHub account you can help us by clicking the star button on [our project page](https://www.github.com/jsxgraph/jsxgraph "JSXGraph GitHub repository").

Enjoy!
