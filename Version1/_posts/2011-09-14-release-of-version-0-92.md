Today, we released version 0.92 is mainly a bug fix release. The number of JSXGraph boards in one HTML page has been increased from 33 to 65535, an annoying bug in IE has been fixed and the calculation of the mouse position has been improved. The plot algorithm now produces better graphs. The slow update speed on Android 3 devices has been addressed and the usability of JSXGraph in XHTML has been improved. The latter feature is important for including JSXGraph in ebooks with the epub3 file format. 

One test example of an epub3 ebook using JSXGraph can be downloaded from <http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/~alfred/jsxgui/epub3/IntroJSXGraph/IntroJSXGraph.epub>. As of today, the only reader programs supporting JavaScript seem to be iBooks from Apple and [calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com). Unfortunately, iBooks does not support MathML, so far.
  
Happy JSXGraphing,
  
Alfred
