Version 0.94 enables the long awaited flexible positioning of labels, e.g. of axes. Now, the attributes can be added to an arbitrary element with a label. `position` can take the values &#8216;lft&#8217;, &#8216;ulft&#8217;, llft&#8217;, &#8216;rt&#8217;, &#8216;urt&#8217;, &#8216;lrt&#8217;, &#8216;top&#8217;, &#8216;bot&#8217;.
  
Further, this release brings improved event handling. Additionally, it contains many bug fixes and better GEONExT file format compatibility. Many other small improvements make JSXGraph programming more convenient, for example setProperty() is now available for groups, transformations can by applied to data plots, and points may snap to other points.
